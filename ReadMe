First step requires to upload all the .class files on to all the instances
To initiate the code, log in from an Amazon ec2 instance and run the ChordNodeMain class.
command: java ChordNodeMain
Both for gateway and other remote server the above command should be executed.
If the Ip address of this server, matches the one set in the Constant class, then this server is designated as the gateway node.

If not, the server is designated as any new remote server joining in. The fist server to be initiated should be the one that matches the Gateway address set in the 
constants class. All the new nodes/Remote server started would join the group via this gateway node. 
The appropriate functions would then be called automatically started from the ChordNodeMain class

For clarity, GatewayThread class is initiated for gateway node and ChordNodeAction class is initiated for any other remote Server node.
Thereafter, the heartBeater, Listener and FailureDetector class is initiated.
